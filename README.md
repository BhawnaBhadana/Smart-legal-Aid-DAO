⚖️ Smart Legal Aid DAO

## 🌍 Problem

Millions of people are denied justice due to high legal costs and lack of access. Existing legal aid systems are underfunded, opaque, and slow. We believe blockchain can transform this — by letting communities fund justice directly, with every step recorded on-chain.
